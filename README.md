Porting RPi.GPIO for Libre Le Potato

Replace

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
```

with

```
import LePotatoPi.GPIO.GPIO as GPIO
```

LePotatoPi is a work in progress and the main goal is to allow people to follow tutorials created for Raspberry Pi on the Libre Le Potato.

import with

```
pip install LePotatoPi.GPIO
```

note: the BOARD layout does not work, you must use BGM
